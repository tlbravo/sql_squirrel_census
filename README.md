# SQL Squirrel Cencus

I used this [2018 NYC dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw/about_data) comprised of over 3000 squirrel sightings and data such as age, fur color, activities, interaction with humans, etc.

The information on this dataset was collected by volunteers. More information can be found [here](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/).

I'm in the process of using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to explore the different patterns NYC squirrels might display. I chose to explore this dataset because it's fun!
